### Download before using

### Description
MyPlugin is aimed at bringing some RP features for players.
I might want to add later pickups that will change you to some role
- RP servers use this as they're way to give roles to players.
Features can be edited or added by suggestion of players so 100% suggest something I might make it.

This plugin is mainly for RP servers without developers.

### Custom Emotes

Okay this is the greatest feature of them all. You can add your Emotes and edit permissions of those emotes.
SCPs are not in the permissions but enough people would ask for this feature it will be added.

* To use emotes, type .me in to console.
It will show avalible emotes.
(No need to type ! or [Perm])

* How to add custom emote?
You simply add them by having somewhere in your schematic name `!`.

How can I change permission of Emote?
You can change it by adding somewhere in your schematic name letters like in example:

* This could only use Class-D
```cs
!Broom[CD]
```

* This could only use MTF
```cs
!Shield[NTF]
```

* All permissions are:
```cs
[NONE] everyone have acess to use the Emote even SCPs you
[CD] ClassD have acess to use the Emote
[SC] Scientist have acess to use the Emote
[CH] All Chaos have acess to use the Emote
[NTF] All MFO have acess to use the Emote
[SCP] SCP have acess to use the Emote
more permissions can be added/edit
```
