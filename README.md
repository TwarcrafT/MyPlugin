### Download before using

### Description
MyPlugin is aimed at bringing some RP features for players.
I might want to add later pickups that will change you to some role
- RP servers use this as they're way to give roles to players.
Features can be edited or added by suggestion of players so 100% suggest something I might make it.

This plugin is mainly for RP servers without developers.

### Custom Emotes

Okay this is the greatest feature of them all. You can add your Emotes and edit permissions of those emotes.

* To use emotes, type .me in to console.
It will show avalible emotes.

* How to add custom emote?
You simply add them by having somewhere in your schematic name `!` and permission at the end `[Perm]`.

How can I change permission of Emote?
You can change it by adding somewhere in your schematic name letters like in example:

* This could only use Class-D
```cs
!Broom[CD]
```

* This could only use MTF
```cs
!Shield[NTF]
```

* All permissions are:
```cs
[NONE] everyone have access to use the Emote even SCPs you
[CD] ClassD have access to use the Emote
[SC] Scientist have access to use the Emote
[CH] All Chaos have access to use the Emote
[NTF] All MFO have access to use the Emote
[SCP] SCP have access to use the Emote
more permissions can be added/edit
```
